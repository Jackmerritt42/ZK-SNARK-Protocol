# ZK-SNARK Protocol Implementation

A "from-scratch" Python implementation of a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocol.

## Goal
To demystify the mathematics of ZKPs by building the stack from the ground up:
1.  **Arithmetic Circuits:** Converting code into math (ADD/MUL gates).
2.  **R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System):** Flattening the circuit into vectors.
3.  **QAP (Quadratic Arithmetic Programs):** Converting vectors into polynomials.
4.  **The SNARK:** Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography to prove the polynomial relations.

## Current Status
- [ ] Step 1: Arithmetic Circuit Construction
- [ ] Step 2: R1CS Generation
- [ ] Step 3: QAP Transformation
- [ ] Step 4: Setup, Prove, Verify
